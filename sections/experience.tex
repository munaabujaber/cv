\subsection*{\textbf{Automotive Embedded Systems \& Test Engineer} \hfill \textit{August 2022 -- Present}\\ (Hybrid, Full-Time)}  
\noindent\textit{\textbf{Maasu BH d.o.o.}, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina} 
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep,topsep=3pt]
    \item Worked closely with clients and engineering teams within the German automotive industry, following the V-model development process.
    \item Lead unit \& integration testing of a harvesting robot, developed with Python and ROS in a Linux environment using pytest.
    \item Designed and executed C++ unit tests for electric drive systems in commercial vehicles using Google Test, ensuring robust coverage and compliance with automotive quality standards.
    \item Designed high-level software architecture diagrams and system-level test specifications using Enterprise Architect, based on requirements and use cases.
    \item Authored system-level test specifications and test cases for electric drive software in Codebeamer, ensuring consistency with defined software requirements.
    \item Led the scaling and verification of embedded control software developed in MATLAB Simulink for electric drive systems, utilizing Polyspace and MXAM.
    \item Led and structured four internships within the company, designing their content and framework to align with the company's objectives and ensuring hands-on practical learning experiences for interns.
    \item Led and managed an internal R\&D project as Product Owner and multi-disciplinary engineer (system, hardware, and software) for a custom small-scale autonomous vehicle prototype, contributing to system architecture, technical implementation, and documentation.
    \item Fully designed and developed two custom STM32-based PCBs in KiCad for a small-scale autonomous vehicle: one for interfacing with a BLDC motor controller and inverter for rear-wheel drive, and the other for sensor integration and steering control via a DC motor controller. Scope included schematic design, component selection, PCB layout and routing, Gerber file generation, and managing communication and orders for manufacturing and assembly.
    \item Developed embedded firmware and software in C for the two custom STM32-based PCBs using the STM32Cube environment, HAL library, FreeRTOS, and Micro-ROS. Enabled real-time motor control via on-board motor drivers and sensor data processing, leveraging multi-threading in FreeRTOS and utilizing communication protocols such as I\textsuperscript{2}C, UART, and SPI.
    \item Fully 3D modeled the custom autonomous vehicle in Blender, including 3D printing and the complete manual assembly of both mechanical and electrical components.
